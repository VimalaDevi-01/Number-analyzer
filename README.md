Simple Number UI
A simple web-based UI that accepts numbers as input and provides specific feedback based on the value entered.

Features
Number Validation: Accepts only numbers in the input field.
Negative Numbers: Displays a message prompting the user to "enter a positive value" if a negative number is entered.
Even Numbers: Displays the next three even numbers if the user enters an even number.
Odd Numbers: Displays the next three odd numbers if the user enters an odd number.
How It Works
Input Validation: Ensures the input is a numeric value.
Conditional Logic:
If the input is negative, a warning message is shown.
If the input is even, it calculates and displays the next three even numbers.
If the input is odd, it calculates and displays the next three odd numbers.
Open the index.html file in your web browser to run the application.

Enter a number in the input field.
View the output or message based on the value entered.
